# Javascript Module Syntax

The following repo has a Google slides presentation about about common JavaScript module syntaxes & how they differ.

You'll find:
- A PDF of the presentation, with speaker notes written in a conversational style, so you would be able to just give this talk else where with zero changes if you want to! (with attribution of course :wink:)
- A markdown transcript.

Here are links to the actual Google slides document:
